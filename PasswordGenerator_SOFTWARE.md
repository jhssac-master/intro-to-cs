Complete the activity found [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/password-generator) from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

This activity/topic can be a bridge between Python (Software) and cybersecurity vis-a-vis password security.

Maybe also talk about how passwords can be cracked and how long it would take to crack some passwords.

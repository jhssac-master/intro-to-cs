# Basic Cryptography

Cryptography is a way of obfuscating(hiding) plain text messages usually using some form of algorithm.

Some Basic Cryptography ciphers are:

- Caesar(shift)
- Vigenere
- Substitution

These are now obselete due to the ease of cracking them, however some are still used for Low Point CTF crypto challenges.

This would fall under cybersecurity, but also software due to needing software to crack some of these.
